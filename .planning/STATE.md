# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Users can go from `create_working_paper("my-paper")` to a polished, branded PDF in minutes — no Typst or LaTeX knowledge required.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Skeleton and Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Skeleton and Pipeline)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-22 — Plan 01-01 complete; R package skeleton + Quarto extension created

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-skeleton-and-pipeline | 1 | 6 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6 min)
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-skeleton-and-pipeline P02 | 2 | 2 tasks | 5 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All three formats ship in v0.1 — they share most of the Typst template layer
- Branding via YAML only — users never edit .typ files
- Target CRAN from day one — R CMD check must be clean throughout development
- Depend on quarto R package for render wrappers
- Format key in _extension.yml is 'workingpaper' (not 'typst') — Quarto resolves as 'typstR-workingpaper'
- Monolithic single-file Typst template for Phase 1 — modular refactor planned for Phase 3
- Linux Libertine serif font selected for academic typographic baseline
- [Phase 01-skeleton-and-pipeline]: fs::file_copy() for individual template files to avoid nesting workingpaper/ subdirectory in user project
- [Phase 01-skeleton-and-pipeline]: system.file with mustWork = TRUE ensures clear error if package is not installed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 has a known research flag: `typst-show.typ` Pandoc variable interpolation for the `typstR:` namespace block changed behavior at Quarto 1.6 (issue #10212). Validate exact passthrough behavior for nested YAML before finalizing the metadata API. May need `/gsd:research-phase` before planning Phase 2.
- Typst version floor: confirm exact Typst version bundled with Quarto 1.4.11 (minimum supported) before writing any Typst syntax; template must not use features from later Typst versions.
